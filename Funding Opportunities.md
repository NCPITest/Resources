## 2023 Interoperability Solicitation FAQs  
_Last update: 05/04/2023_

1. **Q:** How many interoperability awards are expected to be distributed?  
   **A:** NIH has not specified a limit. Awards will be made to submissions with the highest merit per the evaluation criteria. NIH will communicate decisions to the ACC.

2. **Q:** Are there limits to the amount of cloud credits that can be budgeted?  
   **A:** No. Requests should be justified by the work plan. Cloud costs are not in the budget but the estimated need and cost should be noted.

3. **Q:** Which institutions/researchers are eligible to submit?  
   **A:** Proposals must involve at least two current NCPI partner systems, and the lead PI must be from a current NCPI system. Other institutions may partner and each submits a separate budget file.

4. **Q:** Can the announcement be shared with investigators not in the invitation email?  
   **A:** Yes. Share the link to this page and note the requirement to partner with existing NCPI systems.

5. **Q:** Must all collaborating institutes be current NCPI partners?  
   **A:** At minimum two current NCPI systems and a lead PI from a current NCPI system. Additional non-NCPI partners are welcome.

6. **Q:** Must the lead PI be from a current NCPI partner system?  
   **A:** Yes. The lead PI should be from one of the five NCPI systems with institutional attestation and endorsement.

7. **Q:** Can a researcher not associated with an NCPI system participate in multiple proposals?  
   **A:** Yes. There is no limit to proposals per PI or system. Systems should prioritize based on involvement and impact.

8. **Q:** Can a proposal be submitted without a LOI?  
   **A:** Yes. LOIs assist NIH planning but are not required to submit by May 15.

9. **Q:** Is the total budget $500K over two years or per year?  
   **A:** Up to $500K direct costs per year (excluding cloud credits) for a project period up to 2 years. Budgets above $500K/year require justification.

10. **Q:** Can RTI submit a proposal given its role as ACC?  
    **A:** Yes. RTI may collaborate; as ACC lead, RTI provides support but does not influence funding decisions.

11. **Q:** Can a single research objective be spread across multiple proposals?  
    **A:** Yes. One use case can motivate multiple technical approaches and proposals.

12. **Q:** Can projects support integration with RAS?  
    **A:** Yes. Proposals for RAS integration are encouraged.

13. **Q:** How is “actively involved” defined for a partner system?  
    **A:** A system is actively involved if its personnel participate in development activities and its data is part of the use case.

14. **Q:** Do I need to update the LOI after the 4/3 announcement?  
    **A:** No. LOIs are for planning only; submit your final proposal by May 15.

15. **Q:** One joint proposal or multiple smaller ones?  
    **A:** Use one proposal for a single technical scope; NIH may segment aims if needed.

16. **Q:** Must the named researcher beneficiary be a real person?  
    **A:** Yes. This person should be on the personnel list and benefit from implementation.

17. **Q:** Is the 5-page NIH Biosketch format required?  
    **A:** No. Teams may use their own biosketch format.

18. **Q:** Minimum key personnel required?  
    **A:** At least two technical leads (one per system) and one research lead. Budget travel for one in-person NCPI meeting per year.

19. **Q:** Where is the Excel budget template?  
    **A:** [Download it here](/files/2023_NCPI_InteropProjects_CostProposalTemplate_v1.0.xlsx).

20. **Q:** Are indirect costs included in the $500K limit?  
    **A:** No. Collaborating institutions submit separate budgets including direct and indirect costs; only direct costs count toward the limit.

21. **Q:** Will the lead institution issue sub-awards?  
    **A:** No. The ACC will issue sub-awards directly to each collaborating institution.

22. **Q:** Is the “Proposal Questions Due Date” for a separate submission?  
    **A:** It encourages questions by May 1. The ACC will answer questions after but cannot guarantee responses before May 15.

23. **Q:** Should the lead institution include subaward budgets in its Excel file?  
    **A:** No. Each partner submits its own Excel budget.

24. **Q:** Should all content be in one proposal package with separate budgets?  
    **A:** Yes. One project proposal with separate Excel budget files per institution named accordingly.

25. **Q:** Who submits the proposal and budgets?  
    **A:** The Contact PI or Authorized Organizational Representative can email materials to [ncpi-info@od.nih.gov](mailto:ncpi-info@od.nih.gov).

26. **Q:** Are Evaluation Criteria and Review Questions submitted?  
    **A:** No. They serve as references for proposal preparation and NIH review.

27. **Q:** Must proposals include full active co-Is/Senior Personnel or are letters of support enough?  
    **A:** Full active co-Is/Senior Personnel are required: two technical leads and one research lead.

28. **Q:** Will the May 15 deadline be extended?  
    **A:** No.

29. **Q:** Any specific formatting guidelines?  
    **A:** No. NIH formatting is optional; teams choose their own.

30. **Q:** Who answers questions on purpose and scope?  
    **A:** NIH at [ncpi-info@od.nih.gov](mailto:ncpi-info@od.nih.gov).

31. **Q:** One research lead per proposal or per system?  
    **A:** One research lead per proposal plus at least two technical leads.

32. **Q:** Must the use-case lead attend NCPI meetings?  
    **A:** Key personnel are expected at one in-person annual meeting; the use-case lead should be named but attendance is at team discretion.

33. **Q:** Where will the in-person meeting be and how many nights for travel?  
    **A:** TBD. Estimate East Coast, USA travel costs based on prior 2-day workshops; anticipate Washington, DC in Fall 2023.

34. **Q:** Where should citations be included and do they count against the 10-page limit?  
    **A:** Place citations in an Appendix to avoid the 10-page narrative limit, or include them in-line if space permits.
