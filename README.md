## NCPI Dataset Catalog

The NCPI Dataset Catalog lets users view, browse, and search datasets available across all resources to make the most effective use of the data managed by NCPI platforms. This allows biomedical researchers to understand what data are already available to aid with better experimental design of future studies and prevent duplication of current and past efforts.
