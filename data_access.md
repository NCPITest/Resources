# Accessing NCPI Datasets

Many biomedical datasets, especially those with human genomic and phenotypic information, require a formal access process. This process ensures responsible use, respecting participant consent for the use of data, and adherence to data use limitations.

## Quick Start Guide

New to NCPI data access? Follow these steps:

1. Browse available datasets using the NCPI Dataset Catalog  
2. Check access requirements – determine if your datasets need a Data Access Request (DAR)  
3. Prepare your DAR with research details and institutional approval  
4. Submit and wait for review by the appropriate Data Access Committee  
5. Access approved data through your institution's systems

## Finding Data Across NCPI Platforms

Before requesting access, researchers need to identify relevant datasets. The NCPI facilitates discovery through the NCPI Dataset Catalog. This catalog allows users to view, browse, and search datasets available across participating NCPI platforms. It helps researchers understand what data is available to aid in experimental design and prevent duplication of efforts.

## What is Controlled-Access Data?

Controlled-access data includes datasets where access is restricted to protect participant privacy and data confidentiality. This often covers genomic data, detailed clinical information, and other sensitive data types. Researchers must apply for permission to use these datasets.

## What is a Data Access Request (DAR)?

A Data Access Request (DAR) is a formal application submitted by a researcher to an oversight body to gain permission to download and analyze controlled-access data. A DAR typically outlines the research project, specifies the data requested, and includes assurances of data security and adherence to data use limitations, along with institutional sign-off.

### Key Requirements

- For collaborations between multiple institutions, investigators at each institution must submit separate data access requests  
- Each request requires institutional Signing Official approval before DAC review  
- If rejected, investigators can revise and resubmit their requests

## Data Access Committees (DACs)

Data Access Committees (DACs) review DARs. Composed of experts in science, ethics, privacy, and data security, DACs evaluate the research proposal's merit, its consistency with data use limitations, and the adequacy of data security plans before approving or denying requests[^2][^3].

DACs may request additional information if the proposed research is inconsistent with data use limitations or if there are concerns about potential harm to groups or populations[^2].

# After Approval: Accessing Data

## Researcher Auth Service (RAS) for NCPI Users

Once data is identified and DAC approval is obtained, the Researcher Authentication Service (RAS) helps streamline access. RAS is an NIH initiative that simplifies how researchers identify themselves and demonstrate their authorization to access controlled data across various NIH data resources, including those within the NCPI ecosystem.

- RAS uses existing NIH logins including Login.gov and ID.me
- It facilitates a single sign-on experience, allowing researchers to present their authorized permissions to multiple data platforms more easily after DAC approval  
- NCPI partner systems are implementing RAS-mediated access
