# Spring 2025 NCPI Workshop Readout

## Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) hosted a virtual workshop spread across two sessions on May 1 and May 6, 2025. The goal of the workshop was to conduct a deep dive on Search across NCPI systems, FHIR, and data standards to understand the technical challenges that need to be addressed to advance technical interoperability and scientific research in the NCPI ecosystem. 

Based on the output of the workshop, the NCPI Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) will collaborate with NCPI leadership and the NCPI community to develop a roadmap to advance the NCPI ecosystem over the next nine months, focusing on enhancing search capabilities and continuing work towards developing the FHIR Implementation Guide. The roadmap will include key milestones, timelines, and engaged groups/individuals. 

This document summarizes the discussion from the workshop, provides key themes and discussion points, and identifies potential actions for inclusion in the roadmap.

## Workshop Overview

### Workshop Logistics

The workshop was held virtually in two sessions: May 1, 2025, focused on enhancing search across NCPI, and May 6, 2025, focused on FHIR implementation efforts. Each session was structured to provide a framing presentation and overview of the current state, validate a shared understanding of the desired future state, and identify the next steps needed to achieve it.

## Workshop Attendees

Workshop attendees included the principal investigators from each of the interoperability projects, additional team members from the interoperability projects, members of the NCPI Steering Committee, and NIH.


## Workshop Outputs 

The workshop outputs are summarized below. The potential actions for inclusion in the roadmap reflect workshop discussions but have not yet been fully vetted for feasibility, including achievability within the nine-month timeframe and with available resources.

### Key Themes and Discussion Points

* **Unified Search - No Single Door**: Participants find it unclear where to start a search and how extensive it is. An ideal search should have clear starting points and allow deep data exploration.
* **Data Harmonization**: Current inconsistent data standards complicate consolidation and searching. Standardized formats are needed for better dataset alignment, common data elements, and richer metadata.
* **Access and Governance**: Inefficient manual data access application and review processes hinder data accessibility. Researchers want streamlined and easy access capabilities.
* **Enhanced Search Capabilities**: Currently, researchers have limited understanding of available data before applying for access. Ideally, semantic search and pre-analysis capabilities would allow researchers to understand the available data before applying for access.
